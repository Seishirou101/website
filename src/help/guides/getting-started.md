Now that **Tachiyomi** is installed, open the app and navigate to <Navigation item="browse"/> and then switch to the **Extensions** tab.

Find the extension that you'd like to use then press the <Navigation item="install"/> button next to your desired extension and then accept the installation prompt.

::: guide Security prompt
You *might* be stopped by a security prompt while attempting to install an extension. If that were to happen then you need to allow **Tachiyomi** the permission to *install unknown apps*.

## Adding manga to your library

::: aside-guide

Now that you've installed the desired extension, it will show in the **Sources** tab. This page contains all of your sources, which is obtained through extensions, some extensions contain *multiple* sources.

To find and add manga, you can use either the **Latest** button and explore recently updated manga from that source or search for it.

::: guide How to search for manga
There are two ways to search for manga. You can search from a specific source, or you can do a Global search on the Sources page.

You can search for manga globally across all your sources by using <Navigation item="search"/> located in the top-right of <Navigation item="browse"/> â†’ **Sources**.

If you're having trouble finding a specific manga:
* Check your spelling and try again.
* Some sources use either Japanese or English titles. (e.g. Boku no Hero Academia / My Hero Academia)
* Some sources use different spellings (e.g. Bungo Stray Dogs / Bungou Stray Dogs)
* Some sources use different wordings (e.g. 3-gatsu no Lion / Sangatsu no Lion)
* The sources you have installed may not have the manga you are looking for.

If you struggling to find a source for a specific manga:
1. Look up the title on Google or a manga database such as [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/).
2. See if a website or scanlator group has the series, then check the [extensions & sources list](/extensions/).
3. If the website/scanlator group is in the list, proceed to step 4. If it doesn't, skip to step 5.
4. Download the corresponding extension, go to the source, then search for the manga name there.
5. If you found the upload location and it is not in an extension, you can see if its [already been requested or request it yourself on GitHub](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi-extensions/issues). If the website/scanlator group doesn't have an online manga reader, you can download the manga manually and set up [local manga](/help/guides/reading-local-manga).

Now that you've presumably found manga that you want to add, click on it and then press the <Navigation item="bookmark"/> button, it should now appear in your <Navigation item="library"/> ready to be read!
